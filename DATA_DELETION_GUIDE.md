# Lamlayers - Account and Data Deletion Guide

## Overview

Lamlayers is a design and scrapbook creation app that prioritizes user privacy. This guide explains how to request deletion of your account and associated data.

## Important: Accounts Are Optional

**Lamlayers does not require you to create an account to use the app.** All core features work without any account registration.

### Account Types

The only account option available is **Google Sign-In**, which is completely optional and only used for:
- Sharing your Lambooks (flip books) via Google Drive
- Uploading files to Google Drive for web viewing

If you have never used the "Share via Google Drive" feature, you do not have an account with Lamlayers.

## How to Delete Your Data

### Option 1: Delete Local Data (No Account Required)

If you have **not** signed in with Google, all your data is stored locally on your device:

1. **Uninstall the app** from your device
   - This permanently deletes all local data including:
     - Your design projects (.lamlayers files stored in app)
     - Your scrapbooks/lambooks
     - App settings and preferences
     - Favorites and recent items
     - All locally stored images and media

2. **No additional action needed** - all data is stored on your device and will be removed when you uninstall the app.

### Option 2: Revoke Google Sign-In Access (If You Used Google Drive Sharing)

If you have signed in with Google to share files via Google Drive:

1. **Revoke Google Account Access:**
   - Go to your [Google Account Settings](https://myaccount.google.com/permissions)
   - Find "Lamlayers" or "Third-party apps with account access"
   - Click "Remove Access" or "Revoke Access"
   - This removes Lamlayers' access to your Google account

2. **Delete Files from Google Drive (if desired):**
   - Go to [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com)
   - Search for files with `.lambook` extension that you uploaded
   - Delete any files you want to remove
   - Note: Files uploaded to Google Drive are stored in your Google account, not in Lamlayers' servers

3. **Uninstall the app** from your device to remove all local data

## What Data Is Deleted

### Local Data (Stored on Your Device)
When you uninstall the app, the following data is permanently deleted:
- ✅ All design projects and posters
- ✅ All scrapbooks/lambooks
- ✅ App settings and preferences
- ✅ Font favorites and color history
- ✅ Images and media stored in app's local database
- ✅ All user-created content

### Google Account Data
When you revoke Google Sign-In access:
- ✅ Lamlayers' access to your Google account is removed
- ✅ No data is stored on Lamlayers servers (we don't have servers)
- ⚠️ Files you uploaded to Google Drive remain in your Google Drive until you delete them manually

## Data Retention

- **Local Data:** Deleted immediately when you uninstall the app
- **Google Sign-In:** Access revoked immediately when you remove it from your Google Account settings
- **Google Drive Files:** Retained in your Google Drive account until you delete them (these are in your Google account, not Lamlayers)

## Additional Information

### We Don't Store Your Data on Our Servers

Lamlayers does not operate any servers that store your personal data. All data is either:
- Stored locally on your device (Hive database)
- Stored in your Google Drive account (if you chose to upload files)

### No Account Registration Required

Since there is no account registration system in the app:
- There is no account to "delete" in the traditional sense
- Simply uninstalling the app removes all local data
- Revoking Google Sign-In access removes any account connection

## Summary

**To delete all your Lamlayers data:**

1. **If you used Google Drive sharing:**
   - Revoke access in [Google Account Settings](https://myaccount.google.com/permissions)
   - Delete any uploaded files from Google Drive (optional)

2. **Uninstall the app** from your device

That's it! All your local data will be permanently deleted, and any Google account connection will be removed.
